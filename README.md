# GhoulScriber - PWA Text Editor Challenge  

By: Logan Sutton  

## Description  
    
GhoulScriber is a text editor based on starter code for a simple program called `Jate`. The app uses webpacks to introduce service workers that allow for caching in the browser, storage to an IndexedDB database, as well as bundling and a JavaScript-based web development. The user is able to type and edit text directly to the browser, which is saved almost instantly and persists even when the browser is offline or is reloaded.
